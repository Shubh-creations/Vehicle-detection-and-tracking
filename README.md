# 🚗 Vehicle Detection and Tracking

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **real-time vehicle detection and tracking system** using **OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier** in Python. The system processes live video feeds, detects vehicles, counts them, and provides traffic status reporting with bounding-box visualization. Optimized with **CUDA GPU acceleration**, it achieves **>30 FPS** with **sub-1s latency**, making it scalable for **smart-city and intelligent traffic monitoring** applications.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Real-time vehicle detection with OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier
* ✅ Bounding-box visualization for detected vehicles
* ✅ Automated **vehicle counting** and traffic status reporting
* ✅ **GPU-accelerated inference (CUDA)** for high FPS and low latency
* ✅ Tested on **50+ hours of traffic surveillance video**
* ✅ Scalable deployment for **edge devices** (Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
