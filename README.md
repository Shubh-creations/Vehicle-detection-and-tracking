# 🚗 Vehicle Detection and Tracking

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **real-time vehicle detection and tracking system** using **OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier** in Python. The system processes live video feeds, detects vehicles, counts them, and provides traffic status reporting with bounding-box visualization. Optimized with **CUDA GPU acceleration**, it achieves **>30 FPS** with **sub-1s latency**, making it scalable for **smart-city and intelligent traffic monitoring** applications.

## ✨ Features

✅ GPU-accelerated inference (CUDA) - 3-4x performance boost

✅ Advanced vehicle tracking - Prevents double counting

✅ Real-time FPS monitoring - Performance metrics

✅ Enhanced visualization - Rich UI with analytics

✅ Configurable parameters - JSON-based settings

✅ Edge device optimization - Raspberry Pi & Jetson Nano ready

✅ Comprehensive documentation - Full setup and usage guides

✅ Performance testing - Built-in benchmarking tools
